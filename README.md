# todoapp
It's been awhile since I haven't touch/work on Vue JS due to work tech stack preference. For better refreshment, I decide to create a simple todo list.

## Introduction
This app does few things offline.
1. Add, Update, Delete todos
2. Todos stored in localstorage
3. Marked todos as complete

## Getting Started
This app was bootstrapped with VueJS and Vite
1. Install the dependecies by running `npm install`
2. Start the app by running `npm run dev`
3. Working on End-to-end testing do the comman `npm run test:e2e:dev`
